# Project Plan: Grumpy Gamer

## 1. Overview
A project to explore whether AI can beat classic games (Wordle, Sudoku, etc.) using reinforcement learning and other AI techniques.

## 2. Goals
- Implement game environments for classic games
- Develop AI agents to play and master these games
- Build a dashboard to visualize training and performance
- Compare AI performance to human benchmarks

## 3. Milestones & Timeline

## 4. Task Breakdown

- [ ] Set up project structure and environment
- [ ] Implement Sudoku environment
- [ ] Implement Sudoku agent
- [ ] Implement Wordle environment
- [ ] Implement Wordle agent
- [ ] Add training dashboard
- [ ] Write tests for all modules
- [ ] Write documentation
- [ ] Deploy and share results

## 5. Risks & Mitigation

- **Complexity of AI training:** Start with simple rule-based agents, then move to RL.
- **Time constraints:** Prioritize core features, use stubs for stretch goals.
- **Integration issues:** Write tests for each module and integration points.
